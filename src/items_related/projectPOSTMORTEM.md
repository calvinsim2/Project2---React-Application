//===================== PROJECT POST MORTEM =============================================================

Approach and Process

    What in my process and approach to this project would I do differently next time?

Just like my project 1, my project 2 fail to meet some of the goals that I tried to achieve.
Plan, Plan and plan. Some planning was done inititally, but eventually during the component of this project I kind of screwed up,
and the components were flying everywhere, and I had to spent hours trying to piece them back together.

Code and Code Design

    What in my code and program design in the project would I do differently next time?

Definitely make it more dry. Some components to map out the recommended item are repetitive.

    What in my code and program design in the project went well? Is there anything I would do the same next time?

Being able to utilise data obtained from the first API, filter and map it out, and utilise it to fetch another API, I think I have achieved this,
and it is a very important knowledge.

//=======================================================================================================

For each, please include code examples.

    Code snippet up to 20 lines.

//=======================================================================================================

    Code design documents or architecture drawings / diagrams.

Refer to drawio and png attached in 'other' files.

SEI Post Mortem

    What habits did I use during this unit that helped me?

Always ask myself what data I want to put in, what type of data I am fetching in from the API? Decide first before I start to write my code.

    What habits did I have during this unit that I can improve on?

Just like project 1, try to simplify codes, no repeating.
Carefully plan which component should include which, before I attempt to start coding, as this have caused me alot of time wasted.

    How is the overall level of the course during this unit? (instruction, course materials, etc.)

For unit 2, the explanation nodes for React can be more comprehensive.
